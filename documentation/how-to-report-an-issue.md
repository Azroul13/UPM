### Before reporting

If you've found an issue with UPM please make sure that UPM is really the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `@CBA_A3` and `@upm` on a newly created mission.

<div class="panel callout">
    <h5>Please note:</h5>
    <p>It's not a valid to simply remove <code>@upm</code> from the mod list to confirm that UPM is the culprit.</p>
    <p>If the error happens when using a <b>third-party mod</b> contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.</p>
</div>
