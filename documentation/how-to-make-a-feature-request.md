### Requesting a feature
In order to avoid duplicates and keep the issue tracker organized, we have created a common issue for [UPM Feature requests](https://github.com/upmod/UPM/issues/62). Any and all relevant requests should be submitted there, where they will also get discussed and evaluated. Before adding a new one, make sure to check the previous entries from the thread and do a quick search for similar suggestions; please don't reiterate requests for features that had already been accepted for inclusion, or those which were disregarded earlier.

Following their approval, feature requests may be moved by moderators to a separate issue for further discussion.
