**UPM** is a mod for Arma 3 to improve the control, behaviour and realism of AI, partly based on UPSMON and UPS scripts.

UPM allows easy creation of randomly patrolling units as UPSMON / UPS, only needs three basic steps: 

<ol>
<li>Put in your player's unit/group.</li>
<li>Create a marker that covers the active area (this is where the AI will patrol).</li>
<li>Place one or more enemy units (or groups) on the map that call the patrol script.</li>
<li>And that's it...</li>
</ol>

Most of the mod is created entirely new and it has a new structure code for better development and optimization. Some features partly based of UPMSON and UPS have been reworked for this mod.
