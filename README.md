**Urban Patrol Modification [UPM]** is a mod for Arma 3 to improve the control, behaviour and realism of AI. Allows easy creation of randomly patrolling units as UPSMON / UPS, only needs three basic steps: 

<ol>
<li>Put in your player's unit/group.</li>
<li>Create a marker that covers the active area (this is where the AI will patrol).</li>
<li>Place one or more enemy units (or groups) on the map that call the patrol script.</li>
<li>And that's it...</li>
</ol>
